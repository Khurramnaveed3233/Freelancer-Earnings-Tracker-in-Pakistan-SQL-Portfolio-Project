## 🌍 About the Project

Freelancing is becoming a major source of income in Pakistan, especially on global platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, and Freelancer.com. However, many freelancers don't track their earnings, client interactions, and performance trends properly.

This project aims to solve that gap by developing a structured SQL-based solution that enables Pakistani freelancers to monitor, evaluate, and optimize their freelancing journey.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Freelancers often struggle with:

- Identifying which platforms and skills earn the most
- Tracking monthly income trends
- Managing client relationships
- Responding quickly to feedback
- Making data-driven decisions

This project addresses these real-world challenges using a relational SQL database and analytical queries.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL Server** for data modeling and queries  
- **Excel** (for initial data input)  
- **Power BI (optional)** for dashboards  
- **GitHub** for version control and sharing  

## 🗃️ Database Schema (ERD)
